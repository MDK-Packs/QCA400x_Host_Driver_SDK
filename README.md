# QCA400x_Host_Driver_SDK
Qualcomm QCA4002/4 Host Driver SDK

# Purpose
This repository carries the original Qualcomm host driver software development kit (SDK) for the [QCA400x](https://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/files/qca400x-product-brief.pdf) family.
The SDK is wrapped in a [CMSIS-Pack](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Pack/html/index.html) that is required
for the [CMSIS-Driver WiFi](https://github.com/MDK-Packs/QCA400x_WiFi_Driver) for these devices.
